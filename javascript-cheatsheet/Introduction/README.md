# Introduction to Javascript

---

## Console.log()

### The console.log() method is used to log or print messages to the console. It can also be used to print objects and other information

---

## Methods

## Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period . , the method name, and parentheses.

---

## Built-in Objects

### Built-in objects contain methods that can be called by appending the object name with a period . , the method name, and a set of parentheses.

---

## Numbers

### Numbers are a primitive data type. They include the set of all integers and floating point numbers.

---

## String .length

### The .length property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.

---

## Data Instances

### When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type.

---

## Booleans

### Booleans are a primitive data type. They can be either true or false .

---

## Math.random()

### The Math.random() method returns a floating-point, random number in the range from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1.

---

## Math.floor()

### The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

---

## Single Line Comments

### In JavaScript, single-line comments are created with two consecutive forward slashes // .

---

## Null

### Null is a primitive data type. It represents the intentional absence of value. In code, it is represented as null .

---

## Strings

### Strings are a primitive data type. They are any grouping of characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ' or double quotes " .

---

## Arithmetic Operators
 
### JavaScript supports arithmetic operators for:

    <ul>
        <li> + Addition </li> 
        <li> - Subtraction </li>
        <li> * multiplication </li>
        <li> / Division </li>
        <li> % Modulo </li>
    </ul>

---

## Multi-line Comments

### In JavaScript, multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with /* at the beginning and */ at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.

--- 

## Remainder / Modulo Operator

### The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can.

---

## Assignment Operators

### An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them:

    <ul>
         <li> += Addition Assignment</li>
         <li> -= Subtraction Assignment</li>
         <li> *= Multiplication Assignment</li>
         <li> /= Division Assignment</li>
    </ul>

--- 

## String Interpolation

### String interpolation is the process of evaluating string literals containing one or more placeholders (expressions, variables, etc). It can be performed using template literals: text ${expression} text .

---

## Variables

### Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.
