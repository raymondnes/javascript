# Introduction to Javascript

---

## Console.log()

### The console.log() method is used to log or print messages to the console. It can also be used to print objects and other information

---

## Methods

## Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period . , the method name, and parentheses.

---

## Built-in Objects

### Built-in objects contain methods that can be called by appending the object name with a period . , the method name, and a set of parentheses.

---

## Numbers

### Numbers are a primitive data type. They include the set of all integers and floating point numbers.

---

## String .length

### The .length property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.

---

## Data Instances

### When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type.

---

## Booleans

### Booleans are a primitive data type. They can be either true or false .

---

## Math.random()

### The Math.random() method returns a floating-point, random number in the range from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1.

---

## Math.floor()

### The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

---

## Single Line Comments

### In JavaScript, single-line comments are created with two consecutive forward slashes // .

---

## Null

### Null is a primitive data type. It represents the intentional absence of value. In code, it is represented as null .

---

## Strings

### Strings are a primitive data type. They are any grouping of characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ' or double quotes " .

---

## Arithmetic Operators
 
### JavaScript supports arithmetic operators for:

    <pre>
         + Addition  
         - Subtraction 
         * multiplication 
         / Division 
         % Modulo 
    </pre>

---

## Multi-line Comments

### In JavaScript, multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with /* at the beginning and */ at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.

--- 

## Remainder / Modulo Operator

### The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can.

---

## Assignment Operators

### An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them:

    <pre>
         += Addition Assignment
         -= Subtraction Assignment
         *= Multiplication Assignment
         /= Division Assignment
    </pre>

--- 

## String Interpolation

### String interpolation is the process of evaluating string literals containing one or more placeholders (expressions, variables, etc). It can be performed using template literals: text ${expression} text .

---

## Variables

### Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.

---

## Undefined

### undefined is a primitive JavaScript value that represents lack of defined value. Variables that are declared but not initialized to a value will have the value undefined .

---

## Declaring Variables

### To declare a variable in JavaScript, any of these three keywords can be used along with a variable name:
   
   <pre>
        var is used in pre-ES6 versions of JavaScript.
        let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned.
        const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
    </pre>

---

## Template Literals

### Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, ${expression} . While regular strings use single ' or double " quotes, template literals use backticks instead.

---

## Let Keyword

### let creates a local variable in JavaScript & can be re-assigned. Initialization during the declaration of a let variable is optional. A let variable will contain undefined if nothing is assigned to it.

---

## const Keyword

### A constant variable can be declared using the keyword const . It must have an assignment. Any attempt of re-assigning a const variable will result in JavaScript runtime error.


## String concatenation

### In JavaScript, multiple strings can be concatenated together using the + operator. In the example, multiple strings and variables containing string values have been concatenated. After execution of the code block, the displayText variable will contain the concatenated string.
