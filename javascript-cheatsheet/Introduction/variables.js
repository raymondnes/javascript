// Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.

	
	const currency = '$';
	let userIncome = 85000;
	console.log(currency + userIncome + ' is more than the average income.');

// Prints: $85000 is more than the average income.
